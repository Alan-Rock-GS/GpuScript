## What is GpuScript?
GpuScript is free and open source. It is written in C# and integrated with Unity, also free.

### $${\color{red}Any \space\space\color{red} CSharp\space\space\color{red}programmer\space\space\color{red}can  \space\space\color{red}  learn  \space\space\color{red}  GpuScript  \space\space\color{red}  in  \space\space\color{red}  15\space\space\color{red}  minutes!}$$

Program the Gpu in C# and skip learning HLSL, OpenGL, OpenCL, CUDA, and ShaderLab. Write an instruction C# class, and GpuScript generates thousands of lines of boiler-plate C#, UI, and GPU code. Then, fill in the program-critical code, and the project is done.

### $${\color{blue}GpuScript \space\space\color{blue} increases\space\space\color{blue} programmer \space\space\color{blue}productivity\space\space\color{blue} by\space\space\color{blue} orders \space\space\color{blue}of\space\space\color{blue} magnitude.}$$
### $${\color{blue}Instead\space\space\color{blue} of\space\space\color{blue} spending \space\space\color{blue}a \space\space\color{blue}month\space\space\color{blue} to\space\space\color{blue} write\space\space\color{blue} a \space\space\color{blue}program,\space\space\color{blue} finish\space\space\color{blue} it \space\space\color{blue}in \space\space\color{blue}two\space\space\color{blue} hours!}$$

GpuScript turns a laptop into a supercomputer. GpuScript increases program graphics and computation speed by orders of magnitude. Imagine running a 4096x4096 matrix multiply in one nano-second. Imagine running a 4096 Fourier Transfrom in 3 nano-seconds. 

Debug group-shared memory kernels. Learn integer computation tricks to break floating point operation barriers by orders of magnitude. 

GpuScript brings C# Object-Orientated Programming (OOP), limited Functional Programming (FP), and full debugging support to the GPU. 

Programmers can quickly write and easily debug large complex programs on the GPU. Perform all computations on the Gpu, keep all the data on the Gpu, reduce Cpu/Gpu memory transfers, and get higher speed-ups.

GpuScript is integrated with Unity. Unity supports numerous platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Dedicated Server, Android, IOS, PS4, PS5, Web, Universal Windows Platform, tvOS, and visionOS, with practically no code changes required from platform to platform. Unity supports multi-user applications, enabling custom GPU Cloud distributed computing. Unity also supports high-quality 3D graphics and simulations. Unity is free, has a wide user-base, and many training videos are available. In my experience, if you don't use Unity, you end up having to rewrite it yourself, feature by feature, or do without.

*  GpuScript is free, easy to learn, highly productuve, and unbelievably fast.

## Available Libraries

* BDraw: Draw hundreds of millions of billboard/semi-billboard graphics in high-speed, including spheres, lines, arrows, and 3D text.
* AppendBuff: High-speed and high-volume append buffers and prefix sums, with many use cases.

#### With GpuScript, you can write programs with lightening fast graphics and computations on GPU with ease!! :boom:

## More Libraries to Come:

* Backup: Backup files to local and/or external locations
* FFT: Fastest Fourier Transform in existence
* OCam: Orbit camera with legends.
* Project: Project manager.
* Puppeteer: Automate Chrome for numerous web applications, such as web scraping and bypassing APIs (not responsible for illegal usage).
* Rand: Fastest random number generator in existence.
* Sort: Fastest sort in existence.
* Report: Generate reports and documentation with tables, figures, and animations. Full automation of all program features from an instruction file.
* Cloud: Multi-user/multi-process support for distributed GPU computing. Provides >5X acceleration using a single laptop with a single GPU. Even faster for local area networks and over the internet.
* VGrid: Fastest 3D volumetric rendering in existence, with axes grids.
* Views: Customized camera views and other program settings
* GEM: AI neural network with instantaneous and automatic construction of all hidden layers, size of each layer, and all neuron connections. Instant training with optimal fitting, interpolation, and extrapolation. Instant thinking. Data correction to fill in unknown entries, automatic detection and correction of outliers, and fixing jitter caused by roundoff or scatter. Optimization, to find the least number of training examples that can interpolate or extrapolate the entire set. Also supports correlated inputs for predictive analytics, statistics, design optimization, process control, and much more.
* Matrix: Fastest matrix multiplication in existence for a GPU (23 PFLOPS on a common GPU released in 2020). Combined with GEM, results in the fastest matrix inversion in existence. Yes, GEM can perform accurate matrix operations.
* GpuScript sample projects: Fractals, AI data models with predictive analytics, statistics, process control, and machine learning, ray-tracing, particle simulations, and CT-scan volumetric rendering.

<ins>Here is the simplest GEM AI neural network ever: 1 input, 1 output, and 2 training examples (0=>0), (1=>1). It has 918 concurrent hidden layers, 1838 nodes, and 3676 links. It is built with GpuScript on a single laptop with a GPU rated at 20 TFLOPS.<ins>

## Project Status:

GpuScript is now a v1.0 released product. If you find a bug, create a new [Issue](https://github.com/Alan-Rock-GS/GS/issues).

The framework is cross-platform. We will be targeting the latest version of Unity, Unity 6.
