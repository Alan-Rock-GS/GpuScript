# GS - GpuScript :rocket:

##### GpuScript turns a laptop into a supercomputer, bringing C# Object-Orientated Programming and full debugging support to the GPU. Basically, any programmer can quickly write and easily debug large complex programs on the GPU, including both computation and graphics, and obtain supercomputer speeds.

## Project Status:

GpuScript is now a v1.0 released product. If you find a bug, create a new [Issue](https://github.com/Alan-Rock-GS/GS/issues).

The framework is cross-platform. We will be targeting the latest version of Unity, Unity 6.
